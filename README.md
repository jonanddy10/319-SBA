# Vehicles and REST API

This project is a REST API for managing vehicle data. It uses routes and Mongoose to store data into MongoDB.

## Collections

The API manages three collections:

- Cars
- Bikes
- Planes

Each collection is filled with their respective data

## CRUD Operations

 This API supports the following CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations:

 - POST: Create new data
 - GET: Retrieve data
 - Patch: Update data
 - DELETE: Remove data

 You can play around with these requests in the 'route.rest' file.
